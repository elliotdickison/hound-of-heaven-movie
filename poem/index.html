      <h2>The Hound of Heaven</h2>
      <h3>Francis Thompson 1859 - 1907</h3>
      <p>I FLED Him, down the nights and down the days; <br />
       I fled Him, down the arches of the years; <br />
      I fled Him, down the labyrinthine ways <br />
       Of my own mind; and in the mist of tears <br />
      I hid from Him, and under running laughter. <span class="line-number">5</span><br />
       Up vistaed hopes I sped; <br />
       And shot, precipitated, <br />
      Adown Titanic glooms of chasm&egrave;d fears, <br />
       From those strong Feet that followed, followed after. <br />
       But with unhurrying chase, <span class="line-number">10</span><br />
       And unperturb&egrave;d pace, <br />
      Deliberate speed, majestic instancy, <br />
       They beat&mdash;and a Voice beat <br />
       More instant than the Feet&mdash; <br />
      &lsquo;All things betray thee, who betrayest Me.&rsquo; <span class="line-number">15</span><br />
       <br />
       I pleaded, outlaw-wise, <br />
      By many a hearted casement, curtained red, <br />
       Trellised with intertwining charities; <br />
      (For, though I knew His love Who follow&egrave;d, <br />
       Yet was I sore adread <span class="line-number">20</span><br />
      Lest, having Him, I must have naught beside). <br />
      But, if one little casement parted wide, <br />
       The gust of His approach would clash it to. <br />
       Fear wist not to evade, as Love wist to pursue. <br />
      Across the margent of the world I fled, <span class="line-number">25</span><br />
       And troubled the gold gateways of the stars, <br />
       Smiting for shelter on their clang&egrave;d bars; <br />
       Fretted to dulcet jars <br />
      And silvern chatter the pale ports o&rsquo; the moon. <br />
      I said to Dawn: Be sudden&mdash;to Eve: Be soon; <span class="line-number">30</span><br />
       With thy young skiey blossoms heap me over <br />
       From this tremendous Lover&mdash; <br />
      Float thy vague veil about me, lest He see! <br />
       I tempted all His servitors, but to find <br />
      My own betrayal in their constancy, <span class="line-number">35</span><br />
      In faith to Him their fickleness to me, <br />
       Their traitorous trueness, and their loyal deceit. <br />
      To all swift things for swiftness did I sue; <br />
       Clung to the whistling mane of every wind. <br />
       But whether they swept, smoothly fleet, <span class="line-number">40</span><br />
       The long savannahs of the blue; <br />
       Or whether, Thunder-driven, <br />
       They clanged his chariot &rsquo;thwart a heaven, <br />
      Plashy with flying lightnings round the spurn o&rsquo; their feet:&mdash; <br />
       Fear wist not to evade as Love wist to pursue. <span class="line-number">45</span><br />
       Still with unhurrying chase, <br />
       And unperturb&egrave;d pace, <br />
       Deliberate speed, majestic instancy, <br />
       Came on the following Feet, <br />
       And a Voice above their beat&mdash; <span class="line-number">50</span><br />
       &lsquo;Naught shelters thee, who wilt not shelter Me.&rsquo; <br />
       <br />
      I sought no more that after which I strayed <br />
       In face of man or maid; <br />
      But still within the little children&rsquo;s eyes <br />
       Seems something, something that replies, <span class="line-number">55</span><br />
      They at least are for me, surely for me! <br />
      I turned me to them very wistfully; <br />
      But just as their young eyes grew sudden fair <br />
       With dawning answers there, <br />
      Their angel plucked them from me by the hair. <span class="line-number">60</span><br />
      &lsquo;Come then, ye other children, Nature&rsquo;s&mdash;share <br />
      With me&rsquo; (said I) &lsquo;your delicate fellowship; <br />
       Let me greet you lip to lip, <br />
       Let me twine with you caresses, <br />
       Wantoning <span class="line-number">65</span><br />
       With our Lady-Mother&rsquo;s vagrant tresses, <br />
       Banqueting <br />
       With her in her wind-walled palace, <br />
       Underneath her azured da&iuml;s, <br />
       Quaffing, as your taintless way is, <span class="line-number">70</span><br />
       From a chalice <br />
      Lucent-weeping out of the dayspring.&rsquo; <br />
       So it was done: <br />
      I in their delicate fellowship was one&mdash; <br />
      Drew the bolt of Nature&rsquo;s secrecies. <span class="line-number">75</span><br />
       I knew all the swift importings <br />
       On the wilful face of skies; <br />
       I knew how the clouds arise <br />
       Spum&egrave;d of the wild sea-snortings; <br />
       All that&rsquo;s born or dies <span class="line-number">80</span><br />
       Rose and drooped with; made them shapers <br />
      Of mine own moods, or wailful or divine; <br />
       With them joyed and was bereaven. <br />
       I was heavy with the even, <br />
       When she lit her glimmering tapers <span class="line-number">85</span><br />
       Round the day&rsquo;s dead sanctities. <br />
       I laughed in the morning&rsquo;s eyes. <br />
      I triumphed and I saddened with all weather, <br />
       Heaven and I wept together, <br />
      And its sweet tears were salt with mortal mine; <span class="line-number">90</span><br />
      Against the red throb of its sunset-heart <br />
       I laid my own to beat, <br />
       And share commingling heat; <br />
      But not by that, by that, was eased my human smart. <br />
      In vain my tears were wet on Heaven&rsquo;s grey cheek. <span class="line-number">95</span><br />
      For ah! we know not what each other says, <br />
       These things and I; in sound I speak&mdash; <br />
      Their sound is but their stir, they speak by silences. <br />
      Nature, poor stepdame, cannot slake my drouth; <br />
       Let her, if she would owe me, <span class="line-number">100</span><br />
      Drop yon blue bosom-veil of sky, and show me <br />
       The breasts o&rsquo; her tenderness: <br />
      Never did any milk of hers once bless <br />
       My thirsting mouth. <br />
       Nigh and nigh draws the chase, <span class="line-number">105</span><br />
       With unperturb&egrave;d pace, <br />
       Deliberate speed, majestic instancy; <br />
       And past those nois&egrave;d Feet <br />
       A voice comes yet more fleet&mdash; <br />
       &lsquo;Lo! naught contents thee, who content&rsquo;st not Me!&rsquo; <span class="line-number">110</span><br />
      Naked I wait Thy love&rsquo;s uplifted stroke! <br />
      My harness piece by piece Thou hast hewn from me, <br />
       And smitten me to my knee; <br />
       I am defenceless utterly. <br />
       I slept, methinks, and woke, <span class="line-number">115</span><br />
      And, slowly gazing, find me stripped in sleep. <br />
      In the rash lustihead of my young powers, <br />
       I shook the pillaring hours <br />
      And pulled my life upon me; grimed with smears, <br />
      I stand amid the dust o&rsquo; the mounded years&mdash; <span class="line-number">120</span><br />
      My mangled youth lies dead beneath the heap. <br />
      My days have crackled and gone up in smoke, <br />
      Have puffed and burst as sun-starts on a stream. <br />
       Yea, faileth now even dream <br />
      The dreamer, and the lute the lutanist; <span class="line-number">125</span><br />
      Even the linked fantasies, in whose blossomy twist <br />
      I swung the earth a trinket at my wrist, <br />
      Are yielding; cords of all too weak account <br />
      For earth with heavy griefs so overplussed. <br />
       Ah! is Thy love indeed <span class="line-number">130</span><br />
      A weed, albeit an amaranthine weed, <br />
      Suffering no flowers except its own to mount? <br />
       Ah! must&mdash; <br />
       Designer infinite!&mdash; <br />
      Ah! must Thou char the wood ere Thou canst limn with it? <span class="line-number">135</span><br />
      My freshness spent its wavering shower i&rsquo; the dust; <br />
      And now my heart is as a broken fount, <br />
      Wherein tear-drippings stagnate, spilt down ever <br />
       From the dank thoughts that shiver <br />
      Upon the sighful branches of my mind. <span class="line-number">140</span><br />
       Such is; what is to be? <br />
      The pulp so bitter, how shall taste the rind? <br />
      I dimly guess what Time in mists confounds; <br />
      Yet ever and anon a trumpet sounds <br />
      From the hid battlements of Eternity; <span class="line-number">145</span><br />
      Those shaken mists a space unsettle, then <br />
      Round the half-glimps&egrave;d turrets slowly wash again. <br />
       But not ere him who summoneth <br />
       I first have seen, enwound <br />
      With glooming robes purpureal, cypress-crowned; <span class="line-number">150</span><br />
      His name I know, and what his trumpet saith. <br />
      Whether man&rsquo;s heart or life it be which yields <br />
       Thee harvest, must Thy harvest-fields <br />
       Be dunged with rotten death? <br />
       <br />
       Now of that long pursuit <span class="line-number">155</span><br />
       Comes on at hand the bruit; <br />
       That Voice is round me like a bursting sea: <br />
       &lsquo;And is thy earth so marred, <br />
       Shattered in shard on shard? <br />
       Lo, all things fly thee, for thou fliest Me! <span class="line-number">160</span><br />
       Strange, piteous, futile thing! <br />
      Wherefore should any set thee love apart? <br />
      Seeing none but I makes much of naught&rsquo; (He said), <br />
      &lsquo;And human love needs human meriting: <br />
       How hast thou merited&mdash; <span class="line-number">165</span><br />
      Of all man&rsquo;s clotted clay the dingiest clot? <br />
       Alack, thou knowest not <br />
      How little worthy of any love thou art! <br />
      Whom wilt thou find to love ignoble thee, <br />
       Save Me, save only Me? <span class="line-number">170</span><br />
      All which I took from thee I did but take, <br />
       Not for thy harms, <br />
      But just that thou might&rsquo;st seek it in My arms. <br />
       All which thy child&rsquo;s mistake <br />
      Fancies as lost, I have stored for thee at home: <span class="line-number">175</span><br />
       Rise, clasp My hand, and come!&rsquo; <br />
       Halts by me that footfall: <br />
       Is my gloom, after all, <br />
      Shade of His hand, outstretched caressingly? <br />
       &lsquo;Ah, fondest, blindest, weakest, <span class="line-number">180</span><br />
       I am He Whom thou seekest! <br />
      Thou dravest love from thee, who dravest Me.&rsquo;</p>
